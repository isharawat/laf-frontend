## Project Inspiration
Colleges are the place where our mailbox are so much filled with losing/ founding a earphone, key, etc which might have kept in a desk but not sure it's still there. This problem seems so relatable to most of the college students. A problem will still remain the same until someone builds a solution to it.
## Features
You need to login first to access the website.\
It has two separate sections. First, which is used to display the lost items and the second one is for the found items.\
You can also see the listings of items done by you on a separate page.\
If a person found any item present in the lost section, he can message the owner about the location and details of that item. The owner may share his contact number if he found that the details given by that person is correct to proceed ahead. Same goes for the found section.
